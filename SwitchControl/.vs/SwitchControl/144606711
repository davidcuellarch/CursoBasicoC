In other words, the string cannot be parsed as an integer.\r\n\r\nThis might be happening because the user input is not a valid integer. It\u0027s possible that the user entered a non-numeric value, or a value that is too large or too small to be represented as an integer. Another possibility is that there is whitespace or other non-numeric characters in the input string.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, you can add error handling code to check if the input is valid before attempting to convert it to an integer. You can also use the \u0060int.TryParse\u0060 method instead of \u0060Convert.ToInt32\u0060 to handle invalid input gracefully.\r\n\r\nTo get more information about the error, you can add logging or debugging statements to your code to see the value of the input string before it is converted to an integer.
